# poet
A light emacs theme that's well suited for prose: particularly org-mode and markdown-mode; or any mode that works well with `variable-pitch` mode.

## Motivation
The main idea behind this was to make Emacs more friendly for writing prose instead of code. Highlights include mixing monospace and variable pitch text in markdown and org-modes, making it convenient to write prose and code together. For example,

## Warning
This is still a very early version of the theme, and there are several caveats:
- Exclusively aimed at graphical emacs
- Not very widely tested
- Font choices are hard-coded into the theme; Georgia for variable pitch text and Firacode for monospace
- Not published to Melpa yet

## Next Steps
(No fixed timelines for these, depends on my time and motivation)
- [ ] Publish v1 to Melpa.
---
- [ ] Add more screenshots showing off different modes (particularly markdown)
- [ ] Add support for customizing font faces
- [ ] Document `poet-mode` and add to documentation.
- [ ] Document support for additional modes.
- [ ] Add my org-mode theme specific customizations to `poet-mode`.
- [ ] Evaluate & test github flavoured markdown in markdown-mode.
- [ ] Publish v2 to Melpa
---
- [ ] Create a poet-dark mode with a yellow/white/dark gray scheme.
- [ ] Publish v3 to Melpa.
